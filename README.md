# ReactJS Internship Week 2 Task: To-Do List Component

## Project Overview

This project is the second task of my ReactJS internship. The goal is to develop a To-Do List component that allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed. The component also includes input validation, dynamic task display, and optional features such as sorting, filtering, and localStorage integration.

## Features

- **Task Addition:** Users can add new tasks to the list through an input field and a submit button. The input is validated to ensure that no empty tasks are added.
- **Task Removal:** Each task has a delete button that allows users to remove the task from the list.
- **Completion Marking:** Users can mark tasks as completed by clicking on them, with completed tasks visually distinguished.
- **Dynamic Display:** The task list updates dynamically as tasks are added or removed.
- **Optional Features:**
  - **Sorting:** Sort tasks based on creation date, completion status, or alphabetically.
  - **Filtering:** Filter tasks to show all, only completed, or only pending tasks.
  - **LocalStorage Integration:** Persist tasks in the browser's localStorage to maintain state even after closing the browser.
